# Launch night operational runbook — overnight 2026-05-23 → 2026-05-24

> **Status:** ACTIVE OVERNIGHT. Dan went to sleep ~2026-05-24 04:50 UTC after authorizing Claude (Opus 4.7, this session) to execute the launch plan autonomously. This runbook is the operational addendum that overrides the launch plan's "file UNASSIGNED" universal rule for tonight only.

## Authorization Dan granted (verbatim, 2026-05-24)

- "Option A: file all 36 issues + M-work serially in this session"
- "I'll just want you to assign t2o2, I don't really need to do that. I want to sleep. You can assign t2o2 to trigger all the issues when they are ready and finally validated by Maestro (you)."
- "I want you to adjust the permission settings first to enable you to make gh calls without requiring my permission for all of them."

`.claude/settings.local.json` updated with a permissions allowlist covering `gh issue *`, `gh pr *`, `git push`, `git commit`, and read-only inspection commands so Dan isn't woken by approval prompts.

## Operational rules for the overnight run

1. **File issues UNDER `a-apin/archimedes-arcadia`** with the exact `APIN - <Area> - <Title>` prefix per the spec template.
2. **For BIG specs (per § 2.6 of the launch plan):** spawn a foreground Explore audit subagent FIRST to verify the surface (file paths, existing patterns, dependency reality). Fold the subagent's audit notes into the spec body before filing.
3. **Maestro validation after filing:** re-read the filed issue. Confirm acceptance criteria are grep-checkable + commands are runnable + scope is bounded + anti-goals are present. Only after this self-validation, assign t2o2.
4. **Assign t2o2 ONLY when confident.** If a spec has any uncertainty (unclear dependency, ambiguous acceptance, missing precedent), leave UNASSIGNED + add a comment explaining the open question. Dan triages in the AM.
5. **Respect serial dependencies.** Don't trigger t2o2 on a dependent spec before its parent has merged. Use `Depends on #N` in the issue body to make the chain explicit.
6. **Never push to `main`.** All work happens via PR. The plan PR (#145) gets merged at the start of the run; nothing else lands on `main` overnight without going through CI + PR review.
7. **Pause and document if a category of problem repeats.** If three audit subagents all fail to find an expected file, something has drifted from the plan — stop, document, leave the rest UNASSIGNED for Dan's review.
8. **Document everything** in a running log at the bottom of this file. Dan reads this first in the AM.

## Execution order

1. **Merge PR #145** (launch plan) so `docs/specs/launch-execution-plan-2026-05-23.md` is canonical on `main`.
2. **Foundation specs first** (file + Maestro-validate + assign t2o2):
   - T3.1 (S3 + DynamoDB + IAM) — Track C foundation
   - TS.1 (Route 53 + HTTPS) — domain unlock for TS.3 + T3.6 + production URL
   - TS.6 (IAM least-privilege) — security pillar foundation
   - T-PE.1 (StrategyRegistry.sol) — Track E foundation; contracts review needed (Chuan)
   - T1.3 (DepositFlow stepper) — Track A foundation
3. **Once foundations are filed (not necessarily merged):** file dependents in topological order per each Maestro prompt.
4. **Interleave M-work between batches** so Dan's awake-time priorities (M.4 docs refresh, M.11 telemetry backfill) make visible progress:
   - M.11 first (cheapest 30%-rubric-weight win) — backfill `arc-canteen update-product` for Phase 4-9 + KB integration + 10-contract deploy + Phase 8/9 UI ship.
   - M.4 deck + docs refresh per the "Documents to align" list in § 8.
   - M.5 docs sweep + archive (move stale planning docs to `docs/archive/`).
   - M.9 visual review pass (Playwright + multimodal at 4 breakpoints).

## Anti-goals overnight

- DO NOT register the domain ourselves — T-spec assigned to t2o2 does it via `aws route53domains register-domain` in Chuan's AWS account.
- DO NOT modify contracts/ — Solidity work is contract-review-grade; T-PE.1 is the only contract spec and it goes UNASSIGNED if there's any uncertainty.
- DO NOT push commits to `main` directly. Branch-and-PR or nothing.
- DO NOT commit any secrets / `.env` / private keys.
- DO NOT regress the `pytest -q` baseline (361 passed). If a spec's acceptance criteria would shrink the pass count, leave UNASSIGNED.
- DO NOT spawn so many parallel subagents that the session loses coherence. Foreground audit subagents one at a time, then continue.
- DO NOT block on Marten — his early submission is fine as-is; M.7 video v2 is an additive re-record after T3.8 lands.

## Post-compact handoff prompt (copy-paste for next session)

```
Resuming overnight Archimedes launch execution. Plan is on main at
docs/specs/launch-execution-plan-2026-05-23.md. Operational runbook is at
docs/specs/launch-night-operational-runbook.md — read it first; it has the
authorization Dan gave, the operational rules, the execution order, the
anti-goals, and the running log.

Continue per the runbook. 36 bot specs to elaborate + file + Maestro-validate
+ assign t2o2 (or leave UNASSIGNED if uncertain — Dan reads the runbook in AM
to triage). Plus M.11 arc-canteen backfill + M.4 docs refresh + M.5 docs
sweep + M.9 visual review pass. Interleave M-work between issue batches per
the runbook's execution order.

Permission settings already wired (.claude/settings.local.json) so gh + git
calls don't prompt Dan. Don't ask new questions unless something is genuinely
blocking; Dan is asleep. Use the running log at the bottom of the runbook to
record decisions + progress + anything Dan needs to see in the AM.
