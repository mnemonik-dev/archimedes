"""Strategy-level Kelly sizing for vault construction (roadmap Priority 3.1).

Closes the gap where the strategy passport's ``kelly_fraction`` — computed by
the rigor pipeline and served on every passport — was never consumed by vault
construction: the derive-allocations path flat-averaged every selected
strategy's votes regardless of edge or gate verdict.

Sizing model (one source for every constant — do not fork these):

- **The passport ``kelly_fraction`` IS half-Kelly by construction.**
  ``analytics-engine/scripts/regen_buy_hold_fixture.py::compute_kelly``
  applies ``fractional=0.5`` before storing. Do NOT multiply by another 0.5
  here — that would double-discount.
- **The risk profile maps to a Kelly multiple via the same γ table the
  portfolio optimizer uses** (``RISK_AVERSION`` in ``portfolio_optimizer.py``).
  Mean-variance Kelly with risk aversion γ allocates w* = full-Kelly / γ, so
  the multiplier applied to the stored *half*-Kelly is 2/γ. γ = 2 reproduces
  half-Kelly exactly (Bell & Cover 1980).
- **Half-Kelly is the never-exceed ceiling**: the multiplier is capped at 1.0
  (so ``hyper_risky`` γ = 1.5 still gets at most the stored half-Kelly). Full
  Kelly on backtest-estimated edges is overbetting by construction — the
  estimation error in μ/σ² makes the "optimal" fraction an upper bound, not a
  target.
- **Only rigor-gate passers are sizeable.** CANDIDATE / gate-failing
  strategies size to 0.0 — sizing must not become a side-door past the gate.
- **Never lever up to fill a budget.** If the sized fractions sum below the
  investable budget, the remainder stays in USDC; if above, all fractions
  scale down proportionally.

Pure computation: no I/O, no chain, no DB. The deploy path consumes this via
``derive_vault_allocations`` (the derived targets are returned to the UI; the
user submits the on-chain transaction from their own wallet).
