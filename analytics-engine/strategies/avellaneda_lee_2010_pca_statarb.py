"""PCA / eigenportfolio statistical arbitrage (Avellaneda & Lee 2010).

The institutional form of stat-arb. Rather than trading hand-picked pairs,
decompose the whole universe's returns into a few principal components
("eigenportfolios" — data-driven risk factors), strip each asset's exposure to
those factors, and trade the leftover idiosyncratic residual when it strays far
from its mean. The residual is modelled as a mean-reverting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
process and traded on its standardized "s-score".

Requires ``engine.run_multi_backtest`` (it builds the universe return matrix
from every ``self.datas[i]`` each bar). Avellaneda & Lee (2010) is the canonical
reference for the PCA-residual approach.

    "Avellaneda & Lee (2010) trade the residuals of a factor decomposition. "
    "Their method: estimate the universe's correlation matrix over a rolling "
    "window, take the top principal components as data-driven risk factors "
    "('eigenportfolios'), regress each asset's returns on those factors to get "
    "its idiosyncratic residual, model the cumulative residual as a mean-"
    "reverting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, and trade its standardized s-score: "
    "enter long when s is very negative (asset cheap vs its factor exposure), "
    "enter short when s is very positive, and unwind as s reverts toward zero. "
    "They report attractive market-neutral Sharpe ratios on the broad US equity "
    "universe 1997-2007.\n\n"
    "v1 Archimedes adaptation (numpy-only, on the N-feed engine). Each bar after "
    "a lookback warm-up (default 60 bars):\n"
    "  1. Build the universe daily-return matrix R (lookback x N).\n"
    "  2. Eigendecompose its correlation matrix (np.linalg.eigh); take the top "
    "n_components eigenvectors as factors, vol-normalized into eigenportfolio "
    "weights, and form factor-return series F = R @ Q^T.\n"
    "  3. For each asset, OLS-regress its returns on F; the regression residual "
    "is the idiosyncratic return. Its cumulative sum X is the OU process.\n"
    "  4. Fit an AR(1) to X; if mean-reverting (0<b<1) form the s-score "
    "s = (X_last - m) / sigma_eq with m the AR(1) mean and sigma_eq the "
    "equilibrium std. Trade on Avellaneda-Lee bands: open long at s < -entry, "
    "open short at s > +entry, close when |s| < exit.\n"
    "  5. Size dollar-neutral and equal-weight across the names with active "
    "signals (gross ~1.0x split long/short).\n\n"
    "Honest simplifications, disclosed not hidden: (a) we trade the residual "
    "signal by taking long/short positions in the NAMES directly (dollar-neutral "
    "across active names) rather than constructing the explicit per-name "
    "'short beta * eigenportfolio' hedge AL describe — a small universe makes "
    "the cross-sectional basket a reasonable stand-in; (b) we omit AL's drift "
    "(mu) adjustment to the s-score and trade the basic standardized residual. "
    "(c) The paper's Sharpe is for a broad equity universe, NOT a 5-asset "
