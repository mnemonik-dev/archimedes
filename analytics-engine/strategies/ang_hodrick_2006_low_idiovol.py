"""Low Idiosyncratic Volatility — Ang, Hodrick, Xing & Zhang 2006.

Ang et al. (2006) document that stocks with high idiosyncratic volatility
(residual vol relative to the Fama-French model) earn anomalously LOW
subsequent returns. Going long low-idiovol and short high-idiovol generates
a significant premium. This is a puzzle for standard risk-return theory and
has attracted extensive follow-up work.

This adaptation computes each asset's idiosyncratic volatility as the
standard deviation of its CAPM residuals (asset return minus beta-scaled
market return) over a rolling window. Assets are ranked by idiosyncratic
vol; we long the lowest (the 'quality' end) and short the highest.

Requires ``engine.run_multi_backtest``. ``self.datas[0]`` is the market
benchmark (assumed SPY) used for beta estimation.

METHODOLOGY_TEXT = (
    "Ang, Hodrick, Xing & Zhang (2006) show that stocks with high "
    "idiosyncratic volatility — measured as the standard deviation of "
    "Fama-French three-factor model residuals over the prior month — earn "
    "significantly lower returns over the following month. The effect is "
    "economically large: the authors report a -1.06%/month premium for a "
    "value-weighted quintile spread (long low-idiovol, short high-idiovol) "
    "on US stocks 1963-2000, robust to controlling for size, value, momentum, "
    "liquidity, and return reversals. The anomaly contradicts the standard "
    "risk-return intuition: investors appear to overpay for high-idiovol "
    "'lottery stocks', possibly due to underdiversification, leverage "
    "constraints, or preference for positive skewness.\n\n"
    "v1 Archimedes adaptation — CAPM residuals over a cross-asset universe: "
    "we simplify the three-factor model to a single-factor CAPM where the "
    "market proxy is self.datas[0] (SPY). For each asset we (1) estimate a "
    "rolling OLS beta over 'beta_window' bars using the covariance formula "
    "beta = cov(r_asset, r_mkt) / var(r_mkt), implemented in pure Python; "
    "(2) compute residual daily returns r_resid = r_asset - beta * r_mkt "
    "over the most recent 'vol_window' bars; (3) take the standard deviation "
    "of those residuals as the idiosyncratic volatility score. Assets are "
    "ranked by idiosyncratic vol ASCENDING (lower is better); the bottom "
    "long_frac are held long and the top short_frac are held short, each in "
    "equal weight, with positions rebalanced every ~21 bars.\n\n"
    "Honest caveats: (1) Ang et al.'s findings apply to a broad individual-"
    "stock cross-section, not a 5-asset multi-market basket; the -1.06%/month "
    "figure is context, not a benchmark for this adaptation — PAPER_CLAIMED_* "
    "are left null. (2) We use a single-factor CAPM rather than the Fama-"
    "French three-factor model; omitting the size and value factors means our "
    "residuals are noisier estimates of true idiosyncratic vol. (3) In a "
    "small cross-asset universe (SPY, NIKKEI, GOLD, TREASURY, OIL) the "
    "low-idiovol anomaly has a weaker theoretical footing because the assets "
    "are already diversified proxies rather than individual equities. "
    "(4) Short-selling costs are not modelled."
