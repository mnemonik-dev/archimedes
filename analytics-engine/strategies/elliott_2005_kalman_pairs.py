"""Kalman-filter dynamic-hedge pairs trading (Elliott, van der Hoek & Malcolm 2005).

The distance and cointegration rules both assume a *static* relationship
between the two legs over the formation window. Real pairs drift — the hedge
ratio that linked them last year is not the one that links them today, and a
stale hedge ratio is the #1 cause of static-pair blow-ups. This strategy
treats the hedge ratio (and intercept) as hidden states evolving as a random
walk, and re-estimates them every bar with a Kalman filter. The filter's
one-step forecast error is the spread; its forecast standard deviation sets a
self-scaling entry band.

Anchored to Elliott, van der Hoek & Malcolm (2005), "Pairs Trading", which
casts the spread as a mean-reverting state-space model. The linear-Gaussian
implementation here follows the standard practitioner formulation (e.g. Chan,
*Algorithmic Trading*) of a time-varying hedge ratio.

    "intercept between two legs as random-walk states re-estimated every bar; "

METHODOLOGY_TEXT = (
    "Elliott, van der Hoek & Malcolm (2005) model the spread between two assets "
    "as a mean-reverting state observed in Gaussian noise, and use a Kalman "
    "filter to estimate it. The practitioner formulation used here makes the "
    "hedge relationship itself the hidden state:\n"
    "  - State x = [beta, intercept], evolving as a random walk "
    "(transition = identity, process-noise covariance W = delta/(1-delta) * I, "
    "with delta small so the hedge ratio moves slowly).\n"
    "  - Observation y_t = close_A_t with observation matrix H_t = [close_B_t, 1] "
    "and scalar observation-noise variance Ve.\n"
    "  - Each bar: predict (P += W), compute forecast error e_t = y_t - H_t x and "
    "its variance Q_t = H_t P H_t^T + Ve, Kalman gain K = P H_t^T / Q_t, then "
    "update x and P. e_t is the live spread; sqrt(Q_t) its one-step std.\n"
    "  - Trade self-scaling on the forecast error: enter long-spread (long A, "
    "short beta*B) when e_t < -entry * sqrt(Q_t), short-spread when "
    "e_t > +entry * sqrt(Q_t); exit when e_t reverts through "
    "+/-exit * sqrt(Q_t). A warm-up period lets beta stabilise before trading.\n\n"
    "Because beta is re-estimated every bar, the hedge tracks a drifting "
    "relationship (e.g. miners' changing leverage to the gold price) instead of "
    "freezing a formation-window value. The paper is methodological and reports "
    "no tradeable Sharpe/CAGR, so paper_claimed_* are null; the honest backtest "
    "fixture is authoritative."
