"""Transaction-cost + turnover model for the backtest engine.

Motivation (quant-roadmap Priority 2.2): execution realism is decisive — the
Kalman pairs strategy cost-bled to −1.47 Sharpe on 1174 trades. This module
provides the three reusable pieces every strategy can share:

1. :class:`CostModel` — per-side cost assumptions in bps, with per-symbol
   overrides, applied to the backtrader broker per feed.
2. :class:`TurnoverAnalyzer` — measures what was actually traded (two-way
   notional, commissions paid, per-bar commission series) so the engine can
   report turnover, cost drag, gross-vs-net Sharpe, and break-even cost.
3. :func:`no_trade_band` / :func:`position_weight` — a turnover penalty
   strategies opt into: suppress rebalances smaller than a weight band.

Conventions (documented once, used everywhere):

- **Costs are per side**: a cost of 10 bps charges 0.10% of traded notional on
  the buy AND 0.10% on the sell. This matches the legacy flat
  ``transaction_cost_bps`` behaviour (``broker.setcommission`` percent mode).
- **Turnover is one-way and annualized**: ``(two_way_notional / 2) /
  mean(equity) / years``. A strategy that replaces its whole book once a year
  has turnover 1.0.
- **"Gross" means commissions added back, slippage NOT added back** —
  slippage is embedded in the execution price and cannot be recovered from
  broker accounting. Gross metrics are therefore a *lower bound* on the true
  frictionless performance when slippage_bps > 0.
